## Beanmaster

Nodejs Beanstalkd admin console, inspired by [PHP version](https://github.com/ptrofimov/beanstalk_console) written by [ptrofimov](https://github.com/ptrofimov)

Rewritten in Nodejs with ExpressJS, with some improvements

### Installation

```
npm install -g beanmaster
```

### Usage

```
beanmaster
```

And the server will start running and listening 3000 by default

Use `-p` or `--port` to specify port number:

```
beanmaster -p 4000
```
